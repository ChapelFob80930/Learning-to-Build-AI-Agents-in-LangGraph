Subject: Unable to Attend Meeting

Hi Tom,

I wanted to inform you that I won't be able to attend the meeting scheduled for 10 am at Taj Hotel, Mumbai, this week. I apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. However, I will be able to attend the meeting in Bangalore the next day.

Please keep me updated on the outcomes of the Mumbai meeting.

Thanks,
Sarbojit
